# Binary Search Tree

## Problems to be solved
1. Basic Operations;
  - Search a key
  - Insert a key
  - **Delete a key**
2. Min and max;
  - InOrder Predecessor -> min
  - InOrder Successor -> max
3. Check if the given tree is BST
4. Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)
5. K*th* Smallest element
6. Merge two BST into a new BST
7. Correct BST which has exactly one pair of values swapped
8. Maths;
  - Floor
  - Ceil
9. Conversions;
  - **BST** to sorted **DLL**
  - **Sorted DLL** to **Balanced BST**
  - Merge two **Balanced BST** into a new BST
  - **Sorted Linked List** to **Balanced BST**
  - **Sorted Array** to **Balanced BST**
10. Binary tree <=> BST
  - **Binary Tree** to **BST**
  - **BST** to **Balanced BST**
